<ol>
  <li>Go Go Squid</li>
  
   I really like this drama, this drama isn't typical heavy drama but the story of this drama is really ballance between romance, career, friendship, family, and dream.  I've been watching this drama about five times 
    &#128557;for me GGS is the best Chinese Drama ever. The acting from ML and FL are really good, they're really have good chemistry. And the ost from this drama is really touching, nostalgic, and ralate to my reality, so even until now I really often listen those songs. I bravely give this drama 10/10 rate.</p></description>
