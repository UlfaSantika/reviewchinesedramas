  <description>I really like this drama, this drama isn't typical heavy drama but the story is really ballance between romance, career, friendship, family, and dream. I've been watching this drama about five times, for me GGS is best Chinese Drama. The acting from ML and FL are really good, they're really have good chemistry. And ost from this drama is really touching, nostalgic, and ralate tmy reality, so even until now I really often listen those songs. I bravely give this drama 10/10 rate.</description>
